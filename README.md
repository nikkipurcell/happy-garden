# Happy Garden

This is my coding project for Happy Garden - Lawn and Garden schedule. It shows all the recommended gardening tasks for each month. To view the website visit: [Happy Garden](https://nikkipurcell.github.io/happy-garden/).

## Technology Used
This practice project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). I used Yarn for package management.

## What The App Does
In this project I use a data file that contains an array of objects (one for each month). Each object contains a list of tasks. I map through this data array and pass the result to the Accordian component. In the Accordian component I list out each task and any subtasks. It also has a button that when clicked reveals the tasks and subtasks for each month.
